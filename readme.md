## 📌 Project Overview
The REAL-TIME-TRADING-DATA-FORECAST-LLM-GRAFANA project is designed to streamline trading data ingestion, forecasting, and visualization. It integrates multiple technologies to ensure high-performance data processing, accurate market predictions, and insightful analytics.

## 🔹 Key Features:
- **Efficient Data Ingestion**: Trading data is collected from the **Alpaca Brokerage API** using **Kafka**, ensuring seamless and scalable ingestion.
- **Big Data Processing**: The ingested data is processed and transformed using **Apache Spark** for efficient handling of large-scale financial data.
- **Search & Indexing**: The processed data is indexed in **Elasticsearch**, allowing for fast and scalable retrieval of trading insights.
- **Market Forecasting**: A **forecasting model** analyzes the last 30 days of trading data and predicts market trends for the next 7 days, aiding in informed decision-making.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: A **GPT-2-based LLM** generates **market recommendations** based on analyzed data, providing additional guidance for traders and analysts.
- **Data Visualization**: The entire pipeline is monitored and visualized using **Grafana**, offering **real-time dashboards** for tracking market performance and model predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives:
✅ Enable **scalable ingestion** of trading data using Kafka.
✅ Provide **accurate market forecasting** using historical trends.
✅ Enhance **searchability and retrieval** of market insights via Elasticsearch.
✅ Deliver **AI-driven recommendations** for trading strategies.
✅ Offer **intuitive visual analytics** through Grafana dashboards.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher  
- **Git**  
- **Docker**  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EdamH/REAL-TIME-TRADING-DATA-FORECAST-LLM-GRAFANA.git
   cd REAL-TIME-TRADING-DATA-FORECAST-LLM-GRAFANA
   ```
2. Navigate to the infrastructure directory and start the services:  
    ```bash 
    cd infra
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3. Run the Kafka stream processor:  
    ```bash 
    python kafka_stream.py

    ```
Once these steps are completed, the entire pipeline will be up and running, handling data ingestion, forecasting, and visualization. 🚀


## 🔮 Future Considerations

As we continue to enhance and scale this project, several key improvements can be implemented to increase efficiency, accuracy, and real-time capabilities.

### ✅ Transition to Real-Time Processing  
Currently, data ingestion is handled via **Kafka**, but processing is still batch-based. To achieve **true real-time trading analysis**, we could:  
- Implement **Spark Structured Streaming** to process Kafka streams in real-time.  
- Optimize data indexing in **Elasticsearch** to support real-time queries with minimal latency.  
- Integrate **Flink** or **Kafka Streams** for low-latency event processing.

### 🤖 More Advanced Recommendation Model  
The current **GPT-2-based LLM** could be upgraded to provide **higher-quality market insights**. Some improvements include:  
- Using **GPT-4 Turbo** or **Finetuned LLaMA models** for better financial text understanding.  
- Training a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent** to optimize trading recommendations dynamically.  
- Incorporating **sentiment analysis** on market news and social media (Twitter, Bloomberg feeds).

### 📊 Enhanced Market Forecasting  
- Improve the current forecasting model by integrating **LSTMs, Transformers (e.g., Time-Series BERT), or Temporal Graph Neural Networks**.  
- Utilize **multi-source data fusion** (economic indicators, news sentiment, trading volumes) for more robust predictions.  

### 🔒 Security & Compliance  
- Implement **data encryption** and secure API authentication for financial data protection.  
- Ensure compliance with **GDPR, MiFID II, and SEC regulations** regarding financial data storage and AI-based recommendations.  

By implementing these improvements, our project could evolve into a **fully automated, real-time, AI-powered trading assistant** capable of making highly informed decisions with minimal latency. 🚀
